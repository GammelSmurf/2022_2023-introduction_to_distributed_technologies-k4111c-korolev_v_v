          env:

              value: "Vladislav Korolev"
            - name: REACT_APP_COMPANY_NAME
              value: "VKOR_COMPANY"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
```
There are 2 replicas of container *ifilyaninitmo/itdt-contained-frontend:master*. Two env variables were specified - **REACT_APP_USERNAME** and **REACT_APP_NAME** with appropriate values. Also, container port was specified as 3000 because the application is running on this port in container.

The availability of service was checked in minikube dashboard.

Using *kubectl expose* the new service was created for that deployment. The service port is 9090 and the target port of pod is 3000. Also type is **NodePort**, that exposes the service on each Node's IP at a static port.
